Recipe Man


Recipe Man is a Python application that helps users find cooking instructions for various dishes and suggests better diet choices within the same cuisine. The application is built using machine learning techniques to match user input with a dataset of recipes and utilizes web scraping to provide additional suggestions from Google search results.

Features:


Recipe Lookup: Users can enter the name of a dish, and the application will provide cooking instructions for that dish if found in the dataset.
Cuisine-based Suggestions: The application suggests other dishes in the same cuisine as the user's input.
Dietary Recommendations: Users receive recommendations for healthier alternatives within the same cuisine.




Usage:


Run the Flask application:


python app.py
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000.

Enter the name of a dish in the provided input field and click "Search."

View the cooking instructions for the entered dish and explore suggestions for other dishes and dietary recommendations.
